# README

This is a project from TheOdinProject to build a simple version on EventBright to get practice with more complicated associates and queries in Rails
The project can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations

On the site users can sign up, create events, invite other users and accept invitations.
There is very limited validation and user functionality as it is not the intent of the project.
Similarly, there is no CSS and the site is pretty ugly.

* built in Rails 6.1.3 build
* full resouceful implementation of all relationships
* as mentioned, some bugs due to lack of validations

If I come back to this, to do:
* add proper user functionality using Devise
* make a more friendly user experience, like having users being able to sign up directly from an event
* CSS and UX improvements
* add validation to models and forms
* have invites expire somehow once events have happened
* have alerts for new invites etc.
